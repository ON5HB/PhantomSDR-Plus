# Web Frontend for PhandomSDR

To get the latest frontend and see your own modifications; run 'npm audit fix' and then 'npm run build' then it will recompile the entire frontend.
Make your fixes BEFORE you do this, else they will not show up on your websdr-page.

Typical stuff is found in App.svelte / assets / and the .json files, good luck.
